Simulation and analysis of collisionless shock simulations in OSIRIS

### First, run desired cells in write_quantities.ipynb
This will write time averaged quantities in the shock stationary frame to the hard drive, and will make future analysis much easier

Note that you will need to adjust the parameters of the box such that you are integrating over a parallelogram that is parallel to the shock front and also far enough after the shock to see a clear downstream region
